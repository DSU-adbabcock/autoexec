## What is an autoexec.cfg file?
An autoexec.cfg file is basically file containing a bunch of console commands that will automatically run every time CSGO is launched. This is very useful because some of these settings won't persist after quitting from the game for whatever reason. It's a good way to set a lot of settings without dealing with the UI (also, with a lot of these you CAN'T use the UI), and it gives some peace of mind that they'll be correct every time you play.

## Usage
A default autoexec is built into the script. The user can select this if they just need a fast autoexec with some really standard settings.
Otherwise, they'll be given a bunch of prompts for custom settings. The user can enter nothing to keep the default value shown in parenthesis. 

When the file is created, you want to drop the file into Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg 
You'll know if it worked because if you launch the game and open the console with the tilde key you should see a message somewhere saying it loaded.

# Buy Binds
I understand the buy bind portion isn't fully fleshed out. This is something that's probably just better to do on your own if you really care, but if you want a fast solution with really common equipment, this works.
